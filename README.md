### A Guide To Photo Editing  

Hi everyone, welcome to Brush Up! My name is Samantha Savage, and I was asked to write a small introduction to our company for the new hires of 2015! Starting out at a company like this can be very intimidating, especially since most of our clients are fairly famous. However, I want you to know that this can be a very fun job, and you have no reason to stress. The process of editing photos is fairly simple, and even though each step requires a lot of focus and skill, you will get the hang of it in no time. This guide is just a brief introduction, and you will get much more specific training soon. Remember to stay creative with your photos, and have fun! 

For this guide, we will use an example of a model’s birthday picture. Of course, this was taken about a month before her actual birthday so we have time to edit it before she needs to post it on her social media. As you can see, she is surrounded by friends and one of them is holding a confetti blaster. The client has requested that we add pieces of confetti in the air and minimize the blemishes on each person’s skin. 

**Step One:** 
The first thing you will always do when you start editing a photo is to examine the colours. Ask yourself if the colours are balanced; do they need to be adjusted; has the client asked for a filter? The majority of the time, the client does not consider colour when making requests but it is very necessary to improve the picture. Here at Brush Up, we have hundreds of different vinyl screens that you can overlay onto an image to edit the colours. Experiment by layering them, or by cutting them into specific shapes for certain parts of an image. For example, we could make this entire image black and white except for the confetti by cutting out holes in the black and white filter. Although this is a bit out of scope for this project, it gives you a unique idea of what you could do! 

**Important!**
Between each step of the process, head to the printing studio for a process that we call ‘forging.’ In general terms, this means that a printer will scan the photo and anything you have added to it (e.g., a filter), and print out a new copy of the picture with all your changes included. Make sure you do this very often! Most of our colleagues, including myself, will forge an image after every single change we make. Even though this does take a little bit longer, it is worth it. You will have to restart if you make even a small mistake, so having copies of each step allows you to save much more time in the long run. Also be sure to upload each of these copies to our company Cloud storage, because you do not want to ruin the physical copy and have to restart! 

**Step Two:** 
Once the image is colour balanced, you can start to fix blemishes! Most often, celebrities have wrinkles, pimples, or other physical imperfections that they want covered. Even though these kinds of things are very normal to see on our friends’ social media accounts, our clients are paying us a lot of money to have them removed and it is very important to them. To do this, we have an amazing colour matcher in our paint lab that allows you to mix a swab of paint exactly the same colour as the subject’s skin. Then your artistic skills come into action, and you can repaint the blemish to make it disappear. This usually takes several different shades of paint to blend out, so go slowly and carefully. If it takes a couple tries before you get it perfect, that’s alright! During this step, it is very important to forge the image after every aspect you remove so you won’t have to redo it if you mess up on another spot. 

**Step Three:** 
Lastly, some clients ask for some things to be added into the photo. Brush Up does have some pre-made stencils that you can insert into the picture, but you will most often have to take a picture yourself. In this case, the model wants confetti to be added into the picture, so one of my colleagues and I went to our photography studio and shot several pictures of confetti in the air. I repeated Step One of the process to ensure that the colours were as vibrant as they should be, then printed out the photo. I used one of our company’s laser cutters to cut out each individual piece of confetti, then placed it on top of the model’s edited photo, and forged the image. Now the photo is done! 

Later in your training, you will learn where to store the physical copies of your work, how to forge your images for best results, and other tips and tricks to make this process easier for you! Remember that the goal while photo editing for social media clients is to make the image look as realistic as possible. Many social media users do not even realise that celebrities edit their photos, and it is important for us to keep up that charade. This was a lot of information to take in at once, so be sure to ask your supervisor if you have any questions! I can’t wait to see the amazing work that you all will produce! 


### Micro Essay 

My short story is set in a version of today’s world where Photoshop and other digital photo editing tools had never been invented. Written from the point of view of a professional photo editor, my story explains a process that may be used in this alternative reality to modify pictures. It is based on some of the techniques that were used in the past to create advertisements, such as layering photos and painting directly on the picture, and it is combined with some new technologies that could be applied to this idea, such as laser cutters and scanners. This combination of old and new media demonstrates how “new media might be here and slowly changing our user habits, but old media never left us” (Parikka, 2012). As technology advances, many of the principles and ideas of a product originate from a piece of old media, and that foundation will never change. For example, people used to edit photos by using exacto knives to cut out parts of pictures, and layer them on top of each other. In my story, this process became easier because there are laser cutters to do some of that work, but different pictures are still layered on top of other ones. Likewise, there are multiple tools in Photoshop that allow users to isolate and ‘cut’ certain parts of their pictures, and they can use virtual layers to edit them. Even though today’s Photoshop and my alternative version of 2015 use very different technology to edit a photo, the principles of the work remain the same as the old, non-electronic photo editing techniques. In this way, no matter what new technology emerges, the foundation and ideas of old media will never disappear. It is interesting to consider how aspects of our society, such as unrealistic body-image standards, would be different if technology like Photoshop had never been invented.
